    <span>Disclosure:</span> This tool is designed to provide insight and
    opportunities for discussion regarding certain strategies surrounding
    sequence of return risk (among others) that may prove beneficial amid a
    myriad of potential outcomes but that are not guaranteed to to prove so.
    While every reasonable effort is made to ensure proper calculations and
    their portrayal, it is impossible for any software or advisor to accurately
    predict your future. Unpredictable variables can and likely will cause
    material changes in the outcomes projected. Any strategy should only be
    undertaken after discussion with appropriate financial, legal, and tax
    advisors. The data presented in no way predicts what your future tax rates
    or tax liability will be in reality. No implication is asserted that
    undertaking a risk-mitigating strategy, including the one contemplated here,
    is superior to a your current strategy. This does not constitute financial,
    legal, or tax advice to you. Past performance is never guarantee or
    indicative of future results.
