        <h3>14. Miscellaneous</h3>
        <p>
          <ol type="a">
            <li>
              All matters arising out of or relating to this
              Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
              internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any
              choice or conflict of law provision or rule. Each of Licensor and
              Licensee hereby agree that any dispute or controversy arising out of or
              in connection with this Agreement or any agreement incorporated
              herein by reference or any alleged breach hereof, if not settled
              amicably by the parties through a prior good faith negotiation within
              10 days from the date of written notice of breach shall be submitted
              exclusively   to   binding   arbitration   at   the   American   Arbitration
              Association (“AAA”) in Delaware, before a single arbitrator to be
              chosen pursuant to the commercial arbitration rules of the AAA on or
              before ten (10) days from a written demand for arbitration delivered
              pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.  AAA shall appoint the
              arbitrator if the parties are unable to timely agree upon an arbitrator.
              The parties shall be entitled to conduct only such discovery that the
              arbitrator determines is reasonable under the circumstances.   All
              arbitration proceedings shall be closed to the public and confidential
              except   as   necessary   to   enforce   subpoenas   and   obtain   court
              confirmation for the arbitration award.  The arbitrator shall have the
              power to enter temporary restraining orders and preliminary and
              permanent injunctive relief and to allocate costs as equitably under the
              circumstances.  The arbitrator’s award and any order for preliminary or
              permanent injunctive relief may be enforced by a petition for
              confirmation and enforcement of the award in a court of competent
              jurisdiction.  The award of the arbitrator will be final and binding upon
              the parties unless there are statutory grounds to seek vacation of the
              award, and the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction may be
              entered thereon.

              transfer all or any of its obligations or performance, under this
              Agreement without Licensee's consent. This Agreement is binding
